# Python OOP (Object Oriented Programing) Concepts - Overview

This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Each concept is implemented and explained through simple examples in the code.

## OOP Concepts Included

- **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and functionality.
- **Object**: Instance of a class that holds actual data and behavior.
- **Constructor (`__init__`)**: Special method used to initialize object attributes at the time of creation.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism where a class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Encapsulation**: Restricting direct access to some components of an object to protect data.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability of different objects to respond to the same method in different ways.
- **Method Overriding**: Providing a new implementation of a method in the child class that is already defined in the parent class.
- **Class Method (`@classmethod`)**: A method that is bound to the class and not the object instance.
- **Static Method (`@staticmethod`)**: A method that does not depend on class or instance variables.
- **Instance Method**: A method that operates on the instance variables of the object.
- **Getter and Setter**: Methods used to access and modify private attributes.
- **Private Attributes**: Variables that are intended to be accessed only within the class using a naming convention (e.g., `__var`).
- **Magic Methods (`__str__`, `__len__`, etc.)**: Special methods that allow classes to emulate built-in behavior.
