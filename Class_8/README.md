# Python File Handling Tasks

This project contains a collection of basic Python file handling tasks designed to practice reading from and writing to files. Each task demonstrates a different concept of file operations.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1
Check if the word "python" exists in a text file (`poem.txt`).

### Task 2
Simulate a game where a random score is generated and saved as a high score in `hiscore.txt` if it's the highest.

### Task 3
Generate multiplication tables from 2 to 20 and save each table in a separate file inside the `tables` directory.

### Task 4
Censor the word "Donkey" in a file (`file.txt`) by replacing it with hashes (`#####`).

### Task 5
Censor multiple offensive words in a file by replacing each with the same number of hashes.

### Task 6
Check if the word "python" exists anywhere in the file `log.txt`.

### Task 7
Find and print the line number where the word "python" first appears in `log.txt`.

### Task 8
Copy content from `this.txt` to a new file `this_copy.txt`.

### Task 9
Compare two files (`this.txt` and `this_copy.txt`) to check if they are identical.

### Task 10
Clear the contents of `log.txt` by overwriting it with an empty string.

### Task 11
Copy content from `log.txt` to a new file `rename.txt`.
