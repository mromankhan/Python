# Python Dictionary & Set Practice

This project contains small problems to practice **dictionaries**, **sets**, and basic input/output in Python.

---

## Problems Overview

### Problem 1: Urdu-English Dictionary
- Takes a word input from user in Urdu.
- Returns its English meaning using a Python dictionary.
- Uses both `.get()` method and `if-else` for safety.

---

### Problem 2: Unique Numbers with Sets
- Takes 7 numbers as input.
- Stores them in a `set` to automatically remove duplicates.
- Demonstrates set behavior with integers.

---

### Problem 3: Set with Integers, Floats & Strings
- Adds `20`, `20.0`, and `"20"` to a set.
- Shows how Python treats `20` and `20.0` as the **same** in a set.

---

### Problem 4: Empty Set Confusion
- Shows that `{}` creates a **dictionary**, not a set.
- Correct way: use `set()` for an empty set.

---

### Problem 5: Friends & Their Languages
- Takes 5 inputs of friend names and their favorite languages.
- Stores them in a dictionary using `.update()` method.

---

## Concepts Used

- `dict`: Key-value mapping using `{}` and `.get()`
- `set`: Unordered, unique data container
- `input()`, `.lower()`, `.add()`, `.update()`, `.get()`
