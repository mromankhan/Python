# Python Lists & Tuples Tasks

This project covers basic usage of **lists** and **tuples** in Python with 5 small tasks.

---

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Favorite Fruits
- Takes 7 inputs from user and stores them in a list (hard way & loop method).

### Task 2: Student Marks
- Takes marks input, stores in list, and sorts them.

### Task 3: Tuple Append Error
- Shows that `.append()` doesn't work on tuples (because they're immutable).

### Task 4: List Sum
- Uses `sum()` to calculate total of list items.

### Task 5: Count Zeros
- Uses `.count(0)` to count how many times zero appears in a list.

## Concepts Used

- **Lists**: Mutable, use `[]`, support methods like `.append()`, `.sort()`, `.count()`
- **Tuples**: Immutable, use `()`, no `.append()`
